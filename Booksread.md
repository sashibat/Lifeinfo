Page about the best books I read

### Brave new world
- Each plot twist and realization throughout the storyline was what caused the book to become a major page turner for me. How each character was tied in was beautiful as everyone had their place.
- The logitistics on the otherhand of the utopian society didn't satisfy me as much. Part of the drive for me to read a made up society and understanding how it functions and how long it could possibly last. The logisitics for this society relied heavily on the cooperation of people and those that weren't satisfied were sent away. 

### 1984
- The initial feeling of fear felt by the main character got me hooked. I loved the feeling of wanting to live freely, but restricted because of big brother. 
- The construction of the society was very thorough and the idea of people being kept in their place using fear was what gave my support in the story.
