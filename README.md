### Joined quality of life to work on:

- sensors required by a place (need to find out where/who). They need to include less sensors when they measure people's/objects movement as currently the use too many for the data actually needed. The project will focus mainly on programming.

- stroller needed by a mother with 2 children with cerebral paralysis ages 5 and 7. She is requesting a lightweight stroller allowing here to take the children out on her own and allow them to sit side by side. The project will rely on mainly the mechanical aspects of a stroller

### Joined engineers without borders to work on:

- project that is trying to build an aeroponics system. This project is nearly complete, just require fixes in software and bugs
