My name is Sachi Shibata and I am a 3rd year bioengineering major at the University of California, San Diego. My goal is to work with technology that interfaces with the human body such as EKGs, MRI's, and surgical robots. Currently, the first step towards this goal is to working with microcontrollers, sensors, and prototyping. 
I've handled robots for 5 years starting from simple FLL to FTC competing in groups of 5 to 15 people. The set of skills I gained from those years included some CAD work, C++, heavy prototyping with 3D printers and miscellaneous objects (paper, metal, etc) and keeping an engineering notebook up to date.
