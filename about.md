## Current projects

<!---### Joined quality of life to work on:- sensors required by a place (need to find out where/who). They need to include less sensors when they measure people's/objects movement as currently the use too many for the data actually needed. The project will focus mainly on programming. - stroller needed by a mother with 2 children with cerebral paralysis ages 5 and 7. She is requesting a lightweight stroller allowing here to take the children out on her own and allow them to sit side by side. The project will rely on mainly the mechanical aspects of a stroller ### Joined engineers without borders to work on: - project that is trying to build an aeroponics system. This project is nearly complete, just require fixes in software and bugs--->

### Self-projects

#### Rice health 360 competition

- Developed an idea to be able to check an HIV/AID positive individual's CD4 T lymphocyte levels using tech similar to a diabetes monitor
  - beneficial in areas with low resources
  - simple to use
  - strive towards: 
    - cheap but accurate enough results
    - better presentation of idea for all participants

- Working on building a website to represent my name and what I want to do
  - adding pictures from past projects
  - add details about skills
