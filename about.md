  - add details about skills

## Past Projects

### Self-projects

- Created resume entirely in latex
  - Learned latex over the course of several weeks
  - Tested understanding with use of small assignments for class and then googling anything I could't format correctly

- Created a desktop for under $550 running Ryzen 5 with 16gb of RAM
  - Dual booted to run windows and Ubuntu

### Robot competition
- Prototyped a robot to compete for a class project
  - Created a unique scooping mechanism
  - Completed 2nd out of 29 teams

### Clear blue sea
- Worked on a water robot to collect waste from the ocean
  - Developed one of 3 prototypes
  - Worked on schematics and ideas for 2 different prototypes 

### Rice health 360 competition

- Developed an idea to be able to check an HIV/AID positive individual's CD4 T lymphocyte levels using tech similar to a diabetes monitor
  - beneficial in areas with low resources
  - simple to use
  - Theoretically uses antibodies bound to a plate and when CD4 T lymphocytes bind to plate, change in potential occurs which is measured by a device attached to this plate(similar to glucose monitoring device and strip)
