## Qualifications attained

- Learned Latex for fun (resume template can be found under resume tex tab) 2018
  - helpful in that research was required resources ranging from forums to testing what each line does

- Biomechanics-viscoous to elastic materials under different stress normally applied and mechanically applied to test stress, strength, and strain. deformation of tissues/bones, and 3-d stresses on organs and tissues
  - used matlab to calculate vectors for uniaxial tests
  - derived constitutive equations for various circumstances(lifting, pouring)
  
- linear circuits-affects of capacitors, resistors, and inductors on voltages and currents of circuit. Time dependent equations derived

- Probability and statistics-analysis of algorithms, discrete probabiility, and optimal procedures
  - involved using matlab to find how quick an algorithm is and its accuracy

- Java trained from January 2016-May 2017

- Biotechnician Assistant certified (June 2016)
  - used E.coli, PCR, and a hood to transform gene into e.coli (twice: to learn how to tranform genes into E.coli and to find the type of bacteria present in a sample of dirt)
